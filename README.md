# Summary

Ember Data JSONAPI-Adapter compatible controllers, policies, services and generators for Sails v0.12+

THIS PACKAGE DERIVES THE MAJORITY OF ITS ORIGINAL IDEAS AND CODE FROM THE FOLLOWING LIBRARY: [Sails-Ember-REST](https://github.com/mdconaway/sails-ember-rest)

Sails-Generate-Ember-JSONAPI is a port of the popular [Sails-Ember-Rest](https://github.com/mdconaway/sails-ember-rest) library that directly supports the Ember Data REST-Adapter. Although the REST-envelope style format is perfectly supported, Ember.js prefers the more expressive [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) standard.
